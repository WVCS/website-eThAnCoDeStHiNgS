    <p> 
      My AP Project was creating an app that was based off of the recent popular game, Wordle. This pulled a word from a data base of multiple words and then checks to see if your answer is correct. You can put in any word (as long as it's a real word; not all words are in the database that it will check) and it will check to see if you are close, highlighting letters close in yellow and letter correct green just like the game. Unfortunately I have it only programmed to have one right answer so the game is extremely hard. The word will get randomized each time and if you get it correct you will be awarded points based on how many guesses it took. At the end of the game you can save your score with your name and it will be displayed when you start a new game. In addition you can return back to the home page to start a new game or continue an old game if you want.
